## Game Directions:

To play Minesweeper, we will create instances of MineSweeperGame in command line.

For example:

    - In the command line, navigate to the lib directory and run `node`

    - Run `.load game.js` to load the contents of this file.

    - Then create a Game instance and run commands like so:

        - var game = new Game(3, 3, 3);

        - game.playMove(0, 1);

        - game.playMove(1, 2);

        - When done run `.exit`
